============Higher order components=============
 
 it is a component which takes component as input and return a component.

 Higher order function is a function which takes function as a parameter or function as an input return a function .

 These are pure functions  ,means it didn't effect if we change anything outside of the function . for the same input , same output will be given for all the times we call the function.

 Higher order components are also same as higher order functions. which won't be effected if we change outside of that component.

=============Controlled Components && Uncontrolled Components=============
======Controlled Components====
In Controlled Components, state was managed by not only this(self) component but by others like parent component to the component.
In one word , state was managed by other components also , => controlled by other components also

======Un Controlled Components====
In UnControlled Components, state was managed by  this(self) component only. not by others even parent also.
